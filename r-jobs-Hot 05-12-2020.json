        "Text": "Hey,\n\nI\u2019m 100% certain I want to leave my job for a variety of reasons, even if it means I\u2019ll be out of employment for a few months. Reasons include my diminishing mental health at work, my depleted lack of motivation/ambition working there, and a burning desire to go and work in a field more relevant to my career goals.\n\nI can\u2019t however bring myself to just do it. I\u2019ve been working there for several years, and even began a new role there after going through this exact same guilt process just 6 months ago. I accepted a new role there after handing in my notice as they wanted me to stay. I remember very quietly thinking at the time \u201cthis is a mistake, why are you doing this\u201d. \n\nWhile I\u2019ve had some successes and have sometimes felt fulfilled in the role, it\u2019s only in the past couple of weeks that I\u2019ve realised that I can\u2019t continue and this is not sustainable. I feel overall lost in this role, unproductive, and I don\u2019t have the capacity or willpower to try and make it work any longer. I want out, beyond a doubt.\n\nThis time, my guilt is compounded by the fact that I accepted this new role, like I\u2019ve made some sort of blood pact. I keep trying to remind myself that it\u2019s just an employment contract and it\u2019s not a life commitment, but am really struggling. \n\nHow can I overcome this? Even the thought of handing in my notice now gives me enormous waves of dread, anxiety, and guilt even though I know it\u2019s what is best for me right now. I also fear getting a \u201cnon-reference\u201d (e.g. just dates employed, or outright refusal to provide a reference) as I\u2019ve worked there so long I\u2019ve hardly anyone else to rely on. I anticipate a certain level of resentment for handing in notice again, and fear this will influence references. This may just be a part of the anxiety I\u2019m feeling though.\n\nAny advice, or anyone been through something similar?"

        "Text": "Hi there. \n\nI live in Bangladesh and I am looking for a new job. I currently work at a retail bank as a universal banker from 9:30am till 7:30pm to 8:00pm or even 9:00pm. Due to commute, I leave home at 7:30am and reach home at 10:00pm. They only provide a 15 minute lunch break. The work is very multitasking and stressful and high paced. There is huge sales and customer service pressure. \n\nThe environment is extremely restrictive and controlling. You are not allowed to go outside for even a smoke break without verbal permission. For going out for any purpose you need to apply in a computer and be granted leave by two managers on the computer. Such leave is allowed only for customer visits and you need to tell them where you are going and they will later call to confirm if you did go there. They don't allow these for personal reasons except say if you have a visa application (doctor's appointments cannot be made during office hours) or a medical emergency and the reasons has to be included in the online application. \n\nEven if you are visiting a customer for work, the work is such that you cannot leave when you want to. Customers are always poring in, and it takes a minimum of 30 minutes (I have counted) or sometimes more or never to leave depending upon situation. \n\nYou also absolutely cannot obviously tell your employer that you are going out for another interview since they consider it a lack of loyalty. \n\nAlso here in Bangladesh, they usually have 3 or 4 rounds of interviews for each job. These are all scheduled during the work day and cannot be scheduled later. First is a selection, then a test, then a upper management board and finally a CEO. At least that was what I faced in my current and first job right out of MBA. \n\nIn such a case: \n\n* How do I manage to attend the job interviews if I cannot go out once I am at office?\n\n* What happens when I get 2-3 calls from employers in a week? I can maybe not go to work for 1 day citing some medical issues, but skipping 2-3 days is not an option at all.\n\nEDIT: Companies here do not reschedule interviews or offer a videoconferencing one. I asked for a rescheduling with 3 companies and none obliged so I missed out on those opportunities."

I searched the recruiter profile in LinkedIn and found it, it has the premium version so later the person will know I visited him.\n\n**My doubt is**: is it too wrong in this phase to connect with the person? I found other 2 recruiters from the same division, one with the same function and other with another...\n\nI would like to expand my network since i have <100 connections (most of them with recruiters only), and because its a dream/perfect company to work that I thought I would never get a shot at working with them.\n\nIf I shouldn't connect directly with this recruiter that contacted me, then can I connect with the others? Does this makes sense?\n\nI'm desperate to get a job so I can start working and take off my career, it has been a long journey of 1.5 years looking for a job (while I work in part-times) that meets my profile and wishes for a future career in management related to supply chain **or** sales&marketing.\n\nI know when we are a young graduate you shouldn't narrow too much your options, but I felt confident that would eventually find an opportunity in this fields in the retail sector...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for any input and recommendations you may give! Have a great day!"
